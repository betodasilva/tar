{: class="chapter__subtitle"}

Dan Chrystal is an avid student of relationship. With over twenty-three
years of ministry and relationship experience, Dan serves as one of the pastors at
Bayside Church under the dynamic leadership of founding pastor, Ray Johnston.
He is on Bayside’s Thrive leadership team, a growing conference that reaches
thousands of leaders every year, where he oversees sponsorship acquisition and
curating church relationships.

Dan is a vibrant speaker and a dedicated life, career, and couple’s coach.
He is the owner of The Sophos Group, a coaching and consulting firm, and he
also oversees the business side of his wife’s corporation. He holds an MBA in
executive leadership from Kaplan University (now Purdue Global University)
and is currently studying law at Concord Law School.

His extensive ministry background has taken him all over the country, and
he has served in varying capacities, including Lead Pastor, Administrative Pastor,
Associate Pastor, Worship Leader, and Youth Pastor. He has lived in Baltimore, near
Philadelphia, inner-city New Jersey, Central Coast California, Los Angeles, and
now Northern California. In each place, Dan has developed deep and meaningful
relationships with many people.

A champion for connecting people, relationships are at the core of who he
is. It is not uncommon to find him spending time with others at coffee shops,
restaurants, offices, or at his home getting to know as many people as his
schedule allows.

His passion, mission, and purpose are to pass along what he has learned
about relationship from key people in his life, helping others understand and put
into practice what “loving their neighbors as themselves” truly means.

Dan and his wife, Tania, live in Lincoln, California. Together they have
two daughters, two grandchildren, three dogs, and a full life! Connect with Dan
