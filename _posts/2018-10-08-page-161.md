## The Art of Trust

# M

```
ost of us would like to believe we are experts at reading people. Some
people have this gift, however, more often than not, it is a challenge to
truly know who a person really is until after you spend a lot of time with them.
I used to believe that all people had altruistic intentions. Even if they did
something against another human being, I thought they were merely masking
what the real hurt was on the inside. This may still be the case, however through
many years of studying relationships, I have discovered there are people who
outwardly seem altruistic but inwardly crave power, control, and recognition at
the expense of others. This makes it very hard to know who to trust.
There are two old proverbs that I choose to live by (among others), “Choose
a good name over great riches” (Prov. 22:1), and “Bad company corrupts good
character” (1 Cor. 15:33). In other words,
```
1. People are not always what they seem.
2. Be careful who you affiliate yourself with.
    If people are not always what they seem, then how do you develop trust
in a relationship? We had better figure it out because one of the key building
blocks of a healthy relationship is _trust_. Without it, there can be no authentic
relationship.

## Begin with Trustworthiness

```
Have you ever had someone say to you, “Do you trust me?” Your answer
to this question may be in the form of another question,
“To do what?”
Instead of blindly saying, “Yes, of course, I trust you,” we would do well
not to answer their question without first understanding the focus of it.
