THE ART OF FRIENDSHIP 63 |

> know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” (John
> 13:34–35)

Our connections and relationships will have lasting influence and could
potentially change the course of someone’s eternal life. Just like the possibility
of a butterfly’s flapping wings could prevent or cause a tornado, if we could
tweak our perspective just a little, we have the potential of impacting the lives
of those around us exponentially, especially through friendship.

We must understand that we are connected to each other. In the verse
above, Jesus commands us to love one another. If one of us suffers, we all suffer.
If one is honored, we all party alongside the one who is honored. This connec-
tion is how others can find hope. They will see how we are connected, and we
can use _that_ as an entryway to start a relationship with others.

What we _feel and do_ has an impact on those around us. It is up to us
to choose to influence them positively. Here’s your challenge: practice all five
aspects of friendship with those who are already in your life that you call a
_friend_. Then, begin to show them to those you do not know, starting with
connection. Let your emotions and actions be a catalyst for life change in
someone else’s life.
