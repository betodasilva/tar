## Overcoming Inhibition and Insecurity

# I

nhibitions—those pesky little thoughts that keep us from doing something,
accomplishing something, speaking to someone, taking a risk, seizing that
moment, speaking in front of a group of people, getting on a roller coaster,

on others. My inhibitions and insecurities had driven me to judge others before
getting to know them without giving them a chance to share their story. This
caused me to miss out on some great friendships.
That wasn’t okay with me anymore.
It was Bible college during my senior year when my insecurities really rose
to the surface. One of my classes centered around expository preaching and
the end-of-term project was to write and preach a sermon in front of the class.
The instructor and class were to choose two of those sermons to be given in
front of the entire college during a Friday chapel service (the most well-attended
chapel of the week). Those in attendance would not only be the students, but
