| 60 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

just like he did in John 11:33–36.

“When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come
along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit
and troubled. ‘Where have you laid him?’ he asked. ‘Come and
see, Lord,’ they replied. Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, ‘See
how he loved him!’”
Likewise, happiness should also be displayed when called for, just as Paul
taught in 1 Corinthians 12:26, “If one part suffers, every part suffers with it;
if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it,” and Romans 12:5, “Rejoice
with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.” These verses tell us that
if one of us is going through a difficult time, we suffer too right along with them.
If one of us is celebrating a win, we celebrate with them. Doing so shows we are
willing to take on the struggles, pain, and difficulties of our friends, as well as be
happy when things go right for them.

In these ways, the connection we have with each other goes deeper. Display-
ing emotion is part of true friendship.

# 3. A friend sticks with you, especially when the going gets tough.

```
“One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there
is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.” (Prov. 18:24)
```
```
“Fake friends are like shadows. They follow you in the sun,
but leave you in the dark.”

We will all go through dark moments or even dark seasons. Those are the
times when friends double down on the friendship—to be there for each other.
Think of a time when you were going through an extremely dark moment in
your life. Who was there with you? Who stuck with you even though it was
difficult? When you are pressed down and surrounded on all sides, who still sits
with you, cries with you, and helps you? These are friends.

My wife and I took a tour of a cavern in Murphys, California. At one point
in the tour, all fifteen to twenty of us were on a platform with about three or four
small lights illuminating the space. The tour guide gave us the disclaimer that if
we were afraid of the dark, we might wish to climb back to an area that was lit.
No one moved. She said to imagine only having a candle to light your way—and
she proceeded to turn off all but one light that was the brightness of one candle.
It was dark, but we could still see enough around us to let us know where we
were and how to get out if we needed to.
