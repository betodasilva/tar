THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP
{: class="page__topic"}

Becoming others-focused will propel us forward in healthy relationships.
We can check our motives and humble ourselves, choosing to not give weight
to what others have that we do not. If we do need something, like our spouseâ€™s
time and attention, we can resist acting out of jealousy and instead communi-
cate our need in a healthy way. When our motives become others-focused, and
we begin to allow humility to permeate our thoughts and actions, then our
desire to help others will come through. Humility is the antidote to jealousy.
Jealousy cannot reside where humility has moved in.
