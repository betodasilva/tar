| 30 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

During those five years, I grew so much closer to her and valued our
relationship. The healing that took place because I decided to seek reconcili-
ation freed us to deepen our bond. You just never know when those you are
closest to, or even yourself, will be gone. Value these relationships now. Do
not hesitate to love others, forgive others, and seek reconciliation. You wonâ€™t
regret it if you do.
