will not be judged. For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you
use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged” (Matt. 7:1–2). We
have to be careful not to judge them prematurely.

3. Simply put, first impressions are initial feelings, not necessarily
    the truth about them or you.
Have you ever said something in the heat of the moment that you later
regretted? Have you ever put your worst foot forward and wanted to go back
and start over? Or have you been so caught up in your own life that you were
oblivious to the lives of those around you?

Something tells me you said _yes_ to one or all of those statements.
To be fair to others, we should allow them a second chance. We certainly
desire second chances when we blow it. Keep in mind this is about building
_healthy_ relationships. There could be some people who manipulate you and
leave you feeling confused. Chances are, they would continue to do so if you
gave them a second chance.

To be fair, we need to look at all of the underlying circumstances surround-
ing the first encounter. We can ask,

- Where am I emotionally, and what is my situation at the time I
    will meet with _________?
- What happened during the day, or is happening in the other
    person’s life, that could negatively affect our meeting?
- What could have been said about them or about me that
    possibly tainted either perspective before we met?
- If I believe I have received a second chance in my relationship
    with God, shouldn’t I give others that same benefit? Am I
    willing to give them the benefit of the doubt?

# Spiritual Application

In Acts chapter 2, the disciples who followed Jesus were in the upper room
when something phenomenal happened. God met them there and gave them the
ability to speak in other languages.

Those who were outside of the upper room hearing what was going on
with the disciples did not know who they were. They understood in their own
languages what was being said, but didn’t understand why. Those who did not
understand and needed to explain it away wrote it off as drunkenness (vv. 1–13).

This is a prime example of a first impression going wrong. Fortunately,
