| 82 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

```
the one I have with Gavin, is not something that just comes into your life. You
must recognize it, cultivate it, nurture it, invest in it, monitor it, pray for it,
maintain it, and grow it. If you do, it has the potential to change the course of
your life and relationships for the better.
