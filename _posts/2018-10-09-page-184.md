THE ART OF HONESTY 179 |
```
Honesty can become second nature in relationship because we know the
Light of Christ will expose any false motive or deceptive idea. When he does,
we can address honesty with great care, thereby protecting the relationships
around us. I believe this leads to the kind of authentic, open, and healthy
relationships God wants us to have.
