feeling better about themselves. We become someone that others like to be
around. We are less likely to live in judgment and high criticism of others, and
we are also more likely to have people around us because sweetness elevates and
attracts others.

Sweetness in our attitude and disposition, a genuine sweetness of a life that
understands forgiveness, will eventually bring light into the lives of others and
maybe even a smile to their face. Of course, you will always have others who
wallow in their bitterness and inadvertently, or even intentionally, try to make
you bitter as well.

Have you ever met someone that consistently maintains a calm demeanor?
They take things slowly, try to see the best in others, and do not react quickly
to adversity? They seem to have a positive attitude and show respect for others
unapologetically. This is a person that has come to learn that responding with a
clear head and kindness to someone who lives in bitterness can keep you from
falling into the same bitter pool of emotions.

The only response that will help us rise above bitterness is to pray for them,
continually forgive them, and treat them with kindness to the best of our ability. It
can be difficult, but both the internal and eternal rewards will be sweeter.

into a “euphoric” mode.

When I have coached people, I will often say never make decisions when in
any kind of emotional state, whether angry, happy, sad, or jealous. The reason
for this is simple: when you are elevated emotionally, it is more difficult to
operate in the logical and sensible decision areas.

People often mistake happiness as something other than emotion. Yes, you
can experience happiness through a change of perspective, which is the point
I am trying to make. However, happiness should not be a metric for how well
your life is going.

I will be sad at times, especially upon remembering my mom’s passing
from this life. If someone says, “Look on the bright side, you will see her again
someday,” this does not make me feel happy. At that moment, sadness, also an
emotion, can be healthy as I remember her. When I begin to focus on the legacy
she placed in me for service to others, humility, and the ability to hum and sing
