# Chains of Unforgiveness

_“Unforgiveness chains us to the past, poisons the present
and keeps us from what the Lord has for our future.”_
~ Unknown
Chains are heavy. If you have ever carried a set of chains, you have felt
their weight and also the relief when you put them down. Chains are used
for many things, one of which is to confine, hold down, or keep someone or
something within a certain limit. Many times, you will see chains on a prisoner
in transport. Chains is a metaphor for bondage.

Like chains, unforgiveness is a weight we carry with us. We actually place
ourselves in _bondage_ when we don’t forgive. The control we _think_ we have, we
have actually submitted to the person who is the _object_ of our unforgiveness.

Living with unforgiveness in our hearts toward others will slowly
dismantle any healthy relationship piece-by-piece. I have witnessed it destroy
marriages, family relationships, friendships, and slowly eat away at the health
of two of my own family members.

We have _all_ been hurt or offended, whether it is something said or done
directly to us, or indirectly (i.e., gossip, throwing us under the bus, and so
on). Frankly, it feels horrible. Not one person I have met likes to be hurt or
offended. There are those who are quick to be offended (who we would label
as “thin-skinned”). I know, because I used to be one of them and I still struggle
with this today. Thankfully, there was someone in my life who came alongside
me as a mentor and taught me how to have thicker skin—who taught me
about forgiveness. He showed me there are two responses to being hurt and/
or offended. Either we allow unforgiveness to set in because we choose not to
forgive them, or we can release ourselves from the offense or hurt by forgiving
them. When we don’t forgive, it leads to five side effects of unforgiveness:
_bitterness, distrust, insecurity, anger, and resentment._ Let’s start with bitterness.

# Bitterness

_“Unforgiveness is choosing to stay trapped in a jail cell of bitterness,
serving time for someone else’s crime.”_ ~ Anonymous
Bitterness is a major side effect of unforgiveness. When we hold a grudge
(bitterness), the only person who is really negatively affected is us. We continually
remind ourselves about who and what caused the offense, opening the wound that
was inflicted over and over again, never allowing it to heal.
