## H Dedications I

```
This project is dedicated to the following people in my life:
You passed from this life way too soon. My mom.^
Your example of how to connect with others and serve them in love has shaped who I am today. I will always love and
remember you and promise to carry on your legacy for as long as I live.
```
You taught me more in one year of ministry than I learned in Pastor Victor Coetzee.^
when I first graduated college. You believed in me, mentored and taught me, four years of education. I am so grateful I was placed under your leadership^
and showed me by your example what it means to love your neighbor as yourself.

```
to love God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind, To all those who lived what Jesus commanded—^
and love your neighbor as yourself. but has left a mark on so many more than Your life was not lived in vain
you could ever imagine.
