## Dedications

This project is dedicated to the following people in my life:

My mom.<br>
You passed from this life way too soon.<br>
Your example of how to connect with others and serve them<br>in love has shaped who I am today. I will always love and<br>
remember you and promise to carry on your legacy for as long as I live.

Pastor Victor Coetzee.<br>
You taught me more in one year of ministry than I learned in four years of education. I am so grateful I was placed under your leadership when I first graduated in college. You believed in me,mentored and taught me, and showed me by your example what it means to love your neighbor as yourself.

To all those who lived what Jesus commandedâ”€<br>
to love God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind,<br>
and love your neighbor as yourself. Your life was not lived in vain but has left a mark on so many more than you could ever imagine.
