Loving God helps us to know there is something so much bigger than us.
It reminds us that without our Creator, life would not exist. Loving others helps
us to understand we are not the _only_ one God created. We are each unique and
special to Him. If this is the case, we can love others, think of ourselves in sober
judgment, and then truly focus on serving people, especially those in our own
community. How are we exhibiting humility in our own relationships?

My actions do affect others...even those closest to me...especially those
closest to me. There has to be emotional consent to share concerns or speak into
another’s life which comes only by building a solid relationship of trust. And
humility is key to sharing and receiving the truth. These are the relational lessons
I learned from Brian.
