## The Art of Forgiveness
{: class="chapter__subtitle"}


Some not so good quotes on forgiveness:

> “Sometimes the first step to forgiveness is understanding
> the other person is a complete idiot.”

Have you ever heard the expression, “I forgive you, but I will not forget”?
There are still others that say, “If you don’t forget, then you have never
really forgiven.” There are problems with all of these expressions.

For those who say, “I forgive you, but I will not forget,” I doubt forgiveness
was really given. It sounds like a veiled threat. The next statement, _“If you don’t
forget, then you have never really forgiven,”_ is impossible. You can never really
forget what someone has done to hurt you. We were designed to remember.
From the day we were born, our brains turn on the memory banks, and we
retain massive amounts of information. When we are hurt by someone, or if we
hurt someone else, whether intentionally or unintentionally, we remember.

Two phrases we should focus on more are,

_“Please forgive me,”_

and

_“I forgive you.”_

Before we unpack the act of forgiveness, we must understand the bondage
caused by unforgiveness.
