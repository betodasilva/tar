Growing up, I remember thinking that my dad was very strong. He went to
work in the morning, sometimes before we got up, and came home around

beyond belief after that day, but the bonds made for our little dead-end-street
community were sealed even more that day.
Once the decision was made to stay in Maryland, there were a whole new
set of issues. My father was out of work for almost six months. Things were
