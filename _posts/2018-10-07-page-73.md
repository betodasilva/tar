| 68 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

I encourage all of you to lay aside whatever is in your past that may have
disillusioned you to relationships with those outside of your own color or
ethnicity. You may find these new relationships will become the closest you will
ever have. I know I have seen this to be the case, and I desire to continue to teach
my children and grandchildren that heaven will be the most multi-cultural place
you will ever experience, a place where segregation is _not_ an option.

The point of this chapter is this: _relationship transcends external differ-
ences._ My dadâ€™s decision to embrace those who looked different than he set me
on a path of intentionally seeking relationships with those who look different
than me. Wherever I go, I realize that the relationships I can enjoy with someone
who is black, brown, or any other color, is way more important than the differ-
ences between us.
