school’s history where the entire student body was allowed to attend.
That accomplishment set a precedent for my high school career. It opened
doors of relationship with my teachers and other students, and although I still
struggled with feelings of inadequacy, I had friends around me that spoke inspi-
ration, support, and perseverance into my life.
These events taught me the value of being an encourager in relationships
with others. It’s never fun to be a part of a relationship where there is little to no
mutual encouragement. Relationships work best when there is a healthy amount
of support on both sides.
On that note, I encourage you to take the opportunity to be the encourager
instead of the critic in one (or many) of your relationships: your spouse, your
child, a friend going through a difficult moment in time, a co-worker, or even to
someone you do not know, like a cashier, waiter or waitress, or others.
Encouragement is one of the most significant characteristics in the art of
relationship. It can mean the difference in someone accomplishing something of
value in their lives—encouragement can bring courage to someone who needs it.

# A Challenge for You

As you read this book, keep in mind the idea of intentionality in relation-
ships. Think about how you are strategically placed to influence and impact
those around you wherever you go. In Scripture, God has given us an imperative

relationships and purpose in each connection you make going forward in your
life. You are here for a reason, and healthy relationships is a big part of it.
There are three parts to this book. I will spend some time going over Founda-
tions of Relationship. In part one, I will focus on what we need to form a stable
base for any relationship in our lives. When you think of relationship, keep in mind
this encompasses all types of relationships—family, friendships, work, marriage,
children, church, school, and any person-to-person connection, including those we
see at the grocery store, bank, coffee shops, and other places we frequent. I answer
the questions: What are the foundations of relationship? Why do we rely so heavily
on first impressions? What does it mean to have a servant’s heart? What is the
purpose of relationship? What does it mean to be a friend? How do we transcend
differences and build unity with others, especially those not like us?
Part two, Overcoming Obstacles in Relationship , answers questions such
as: What holds us back from making connections with others and deepening
relationships? How does jealousy play a negative role in my life with others? Are
we supposed to disconnect in relationship with others? Aren’t we supposed to
