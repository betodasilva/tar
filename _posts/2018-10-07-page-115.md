## Overcoming Jealousy

```
y dogs have always craved attention. At one time we had three—a basset
hound, mini-dachshund (now passed), and a chihuahua mix (a mix with
what we haven’t figured out yet!). If I called one of them, all of them would
come. If I started to pet one of them, the others jumped up and came over to
get the attention. The dachshund, with his mini legs, propped his front paws up
onto the basset. The chihuahua leaped and also propped herself onto either dog.
All of them vied for the two hands I had to offer them. It was a challenge at first,
but I developed a sweeping petting motion to get all three! It is very affirming to
have pets bark and greet you when you come home.
The great thing about pets is they cannot talk back to you. If there is a conflict
with one of them, they get scolded, and eventually, they come right back begging
for your attention! Could you imagine a workplace like that? I can’t either.
Dogs are pack animals. There is an alpha, and all the other dogs contend
for the attention of that alpha, if even just to be considered higher in the order.
In the house, my (now two) dogs consider me the alpha. If one of them is getting
something from me, the other one comes over to receive it too. This is especially
true if I am pulling apart a rotisserie chicken. They both sit patiently watching
every move my hands make. If I raise my hand with a piece of meat in it, their
heads lift up. If I toss it in the air, they compete to get it.
The chihuahua is the worst offender, but also one of the most loving
creatures. She will literally push herself into the fray and place her head under
my hand to get the affection over the dog. I can only give her a smile and a
chuckle as I equally spread the love for both. What is it that causes this response
in dogs? For that matter, what is it that causes a similar reaction in people?
When someone else receives an award...
When someone else goes on a vacation to a place we have always desired
to go...
