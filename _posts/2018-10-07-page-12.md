The destructive aspects of isolation are unbelievably powerful. Discon-
nected people are more emotionally isolated and are prone to depression,
anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, substance abuse, sexual addiction, and diffi-
culties with eating and sleeping—all because it is not good to be alone...that’s
disconnection physically and emotionally. It takes a huge toll.

Listen, this is how strong this is. People who have bad health habits, like
cigarette smoking, overeating, elevated blood pressure, and physical inactivity
but are connected, _live longer_ than people who have great health habits but are
disconnected and isolated.

The poster boy for this might be Winston Churchill. Churchill had deep
connections. He had a wonderful marriage, was connected to his family, his
friends, his nation, and his work. His health habits were terrible. His diet was
awful. He smoked cigars all the time. He drank too much, had weird sleep
habits, was completely sedentary, but he lived to be the ripe old age of ninety!
Somebody questioned him one time, _“Winston, do you ever exercise?”_ This was
his response, _“The only exercise I get is serving as a pallbearer for my friends
who died while they were exercising.”_ This could be the power of connection.

This is the _best_ practical book on building relationships that I have read
this year! And just in time. Why? Because today most people have hundreds
of _online_ friends—but no _real-life_ relationships. I have talked to hundreds of
people who tell me, _“I can’t find friends.”_ That’s why I tell them great friendships
are never “found”—they are “built.”This book will give you all the tools you
need to start building!
