| 156 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

that for you to love them, you need to agree with everything they believe
in. Love is sometimes described as a “two-way street.” Although I believe a
relationship is so much more meaningful when the love you show others is
reciprocated, it is not necessary when it comes to loving another human being
by our actions.

“Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy, it does not
boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not
self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of
wrongs.” (1 Cor. 13:4–5, NIV)
Put these principles to work in your love toward others. It is a daily,
continual decision that in the end will benefit you inwardly. What you will find
is that you will develop meaningful relationships with many people...and not
just those that you are most comfortable being around.

Choose to love...
