THE PURPOSE OF RELATIONSHIP 49 |

members will become lifelong friends and therefore solidify the team forever.
However, the hope should be to tap into the desire for others to be known, seen,
and recognized.

If we dig deep down into our thoughts and feelings, we desire companion-
ship to be accepted, to have friends, to feel valued, to make a difference, to be
noticed, and to be seen. All of these desires can only be realized in the context
of relationship with others. There is something deep-rooted in us that desires
companionship with others.

I have met and talked to many people who had as their goal to “make it to
the top.” One common thread among the ones who didn’t value the relationships
in their life was the realization that they didn’t have any meaningful friendships.
What good is it to rise to the top of any field or any ladder if you cannot share it
in some way with those you have gathered around you to share life? What good is
it if you do not have companionship with others?

This may be difficult for some reading this book, as you may be a “get-the-
work-done” type of person. I am especially challenging you to stop, look around
at the people in your life, and take time to be present with them. Go ahead and
strive to be the best at what you do. Just remember, being the best at what you do
includes as a vital part of the equation...valuing others, developing companion-
ship and shared goals, and an expanding relational capacity. And may I add that
relationship can cause us to grow as people? It’s true! Through friction, conflict,
and adjusting to different personalities, we can experience positive growth and
gain depth in our lives because of them.

Throughout our lives, it is so important to cultivate purposeful, inten-
tional relationships. It is common in those over the age of sixty-five to struggle
with loneliness and a lack of meaning and purpose. Retirement causes a loss of
relationships, and many retirees miss the socialization aspect of the workplace.
Also, families tend to put those who are retired on the backburner. Many go
back to work solely for the sake of connection and companionship with others.
They have to find ways to connect with others.

The challenge is this: begin to develop relationships that grow from
acquaintances to meaningful connections—the true purpose of relationship.
Become one who strives to improve your relational capacity to enhance your
existing and future relationships—this will undoubtedly improve your life, your
work, your leadership, and well...your contacts.
