THE ART OF THE QUESTION 189 |
```
questions is one of the best ways to continue to develop an understanding of
others and move into a deeper relationship with them.

God has created us for relationship. There are always going to be new
people that enter into my life that I can get to know. Questions help us on our
journey to discover the lost art of relationship. It is one of the keys to develop-
ing into the kind of person who humbles themselves and does not think they
are higher than others. If you donâ€™t ask questions, could it be that we think we
are better than those around us and have it all figured out?

It always feels good to know the answer, and it starts with a question!
Why not go on a journey of discovery?
Are you ready?
