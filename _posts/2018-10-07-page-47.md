THE ART OF FORGIVENESS
{: class="page__topic"}

has shown me that it is possible to live in relationship with others, to have deep,
meaningful friendships, and to love others as I love myself.

Right after Jesus gave the disciples an example of prayer, he made a
statement that haunts me. He said this to his followers, which means that he
takes this matter of forgiveness very seriously:

> “For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
> your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not
> forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.”
> (Matt. 6:14–15)

Not only does forgiving others free you to live unhindered in relationship
with others, but it also frees you to live unhindered in relationships with God.

This verse may sound confusing at first. If we ask forgiveness from God,
why would He not grant it? Someone who has truly understood the cost of
forgiveness from God, through His Son, Jesus, will know that if we can be
forgiven from so much, we should forgive others for the offenses and hurts they
have caused.

### Side Effects of Forgiveness

Living a life of forgiveness has its own side effects that are much more
beneficial to us—they are _sweetness, happiness, and joy._

#### Sweetness

I am _not_ a big fan of eating bitter foods! I drink sweet tea, sweet coffee,
eat ice cream, and absolutely _love_ sweet chocolate. Place anything in front of me
that has sugar, a dusting of sugar, icing, and so forth, and I will most likely try
it. What I have trouble with is bitter things—grapefruit juice, arugula, and black
coffee are not my favorites. And may I add, bitter people, are not high on my list
of those I wish to spend time with. Who really does? I say, no one.

Bitter people are not fun to be around. I have a term for them...EGRs...
meaning “Extra Grace is Required” if you pursue relationship with a bitter
person. Bitter people lose friends, and deep down their bitterness grows each
time a relationship walks away.

#### You cannot forgive and maintain bitterness.

When you live a lifestyle of forgiveness, you just become sweeter to be
around. You are less likely to leave a bitter taste and more likely to leave people
