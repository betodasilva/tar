hhhhhhh, love!
What comes to your mind when you hear the word love?
Romance? Emotions? A honeymoon? Funny feelings in your tummy?
Kissing? Hugs?
Interestingly enough, I put this phrase into Google, “first thing you think
of when you hear love,” and the first link to pop up was a Yahoo Answers link.
Here are some of the answers it gave, in no particular order:
Fairytale
Anger, pain, and sadness
...being hurt
It’s an illusion
What IS it?
What was your first thought?
For the most part, we have allowed our society to dictate to us what love is.
The first thing we must realize is that love has no working definition. What?!?!
Try to define it, and someone else will come up with another definition entirely
different than yours. Also, some of us define love based on our own experi-
ences, whether positive or negative. Some would define love as “hugging your
children,” while another might say “what you feel on your wedding day.” The
two are very different emotions/feelings. Some may even define love as a sexual
relationship or attraction. But is this love?
