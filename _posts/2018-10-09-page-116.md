OVERCOMING UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS
{: class="page__topic"}

Him. When we do build our relationship with God, we find our relationships
with others is brought more into focus. We see others as “worthy” of the life
of Jesus on the cross. We begin to see how humility is our friend and not
a weakness. We can place all of our relationships into perspective and have
discernment when one is failing, and wisdom about what to do when one
needs to be nurtured.

Take some time right now. If you are inclined, place this book down, and
get alone with God. Pray over your relationships and consider what God is
telling you about them.
