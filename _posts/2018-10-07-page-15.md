fell dead in the middle of a game. I took the news pretty hard. I sank to the floor
leaning on the door of the bathroom and cried.

Not only was he the first person to give me a job, but he was the first person
(other than my father, who I consider my hero) to teach me valuable lessons about
hard work, discipline, and the importance of relationship. I did not know it then,
but the lessons on relationship would deepen in the coming year.

John’s wife, Marge Kafka, asked me to continue coming and helping around
the outside of the house. I weeded the rock garden and all around their flower
beds. It was a lot of territory to cover. I was now thirteen, making fifty dollars
every Saturday.

An unexpected thing happened while I worked there for Marge. She invited
me in to have lunch, and we spent two to three hours every Saturday just talking
and keeping each other company. She had become very lonely with her kids out
of the house and her husband gone. I always worried that I wasn’t getting the
work completed, but she reassured me that her money was being well spent.

What I discovered later was that she desired relationship and companion-
ship, conversation, and a feeling of belonging. She found it in a thirteen-year-old
teenager. During a time when a teenager’s life typically becomes more about
them than others, I was learning the importance of time well-spent with someone
who needed connection. I’m convinced she saw me as her adopted grandson. She
even let me swim in her pool on the hot Saturdays after I got done working until
my dad came to pick me up. I only worked for Marge another eighteen months
until I was old enough to get a job in a bookstore closer to home.

I learned many valuable lessons, such as the significance of putting others
first, that merely being there for someone matters, the importance of a firm
handshake, the value of hard work, and the necessity of seeing value in others.
These formed the basis of almost thirty years and counting of learning about
relationships that continues today and will until my life is over. I am forever
grateful to the Kafkas for teaching me so much.

### The Wonder Years

Have you ever seen the show _The Wonder Years?_ I loved that show.

During some of my teenage years, I felt a lot like Kevin Arnold. It was an
age of discovery, identity, and development. I sometimes “wonder” how I made
it out of that part of my life! That may be why they named the show that name.
And yes, it always helps to have a brother who is older and in the same high
school, at least for a year.
