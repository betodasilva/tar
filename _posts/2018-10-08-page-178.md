| 178 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

mistakes, and the challenges we face. We cannot see inside this
box, the box representing the heart as described in Scripture
by Jeremiah,
“The human heart is the most deceitful of all things,
and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it
is? But I, the Lord, search all hearts and examine secret
motives. I give all people their due rewards, according
to what their actions deserve.” (Jer. 17:9–10)
Our hearts are dark, and even we cannot see how dark it
really is. We can only reflect the outward appearance of who
we believe we are to others. What makes up who we think we
are can determine the course of any relationship positively or
negatively.
We can pretend our faults don’t exist and attempt to
cover them up, but at the end of the day when we take off our
masks, let our hair down, and settle into the privacy of our
lives, we see reality staring back at us in the mirror. The reality
is that our hearts are dark and even we do not understand our
motives sometimes. We need to be honest with ourselves.
Something happens when we recognize our need for Jesus
in our lives. When our eyes are opened, and we admit our
sinful dark-hearted condition and accept the forgiveness Jesus
gave to us through his death and resurrection, a light turns on
in our heart! (Cue the light in the box.)
Everything that is dark in our hearts becomes exposed
to the light as Jesus sets up residence in our lives. At the very
moment when the light comes on, an image of Jesus automat-
ically superimposes your own reflection in the mirror.
Now when you look at yourself in the mirror, you see
Jesus inside you. You can now reflect a changed heart and a
renewed mind to others because of the Light of Christ that
resides in your heart. Others can now see Jesus inside of you,
too. Because of Jesus, you can totally be honest with yourself
and others, and you can live honestly with others.
When we live with the light of Jesus in our hearts, all of
the dark places of our hearts are exposed. He makes them
right by purifying our intentions and motives and allowing us
to see ourselves and others through his eyes and perspective.
