THE ART OF FIRST IMPRESSIONS 23 |
```
Those who are in higher positions do not need to meet with everyone—it
is impossible; otherwise they may never be able to get anything done. However,
when they _do_ meet with someone, they should carve out more time than one to
two minutes.

Don’t underestimate your own influence and overestimate your instincts
on people. Our instincts are just not that dialed in. Be intentional with those
you spend time with and be honest up front. Just as much as you are making an
assessment on another person in thirty seconds, they are also thinking the same
thing about you.

_Give your time._

_Give of yourself._

Be intentional in your first impressions where you decide to be yourself and
allow others to do the same.
