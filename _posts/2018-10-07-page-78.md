| 62 THE LOST ART OF RELATIONSHIP

“Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who
live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch
yourselves, or you also may be tempted.” (Gal. 6:1)
“If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just
between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won
them over.” (Matt. 18:15)
Both of these verses give us permission to be a friend to others, to tell them
the truth in love, and even potentially spare them from the consequences of a
failure. Friends need to consistently and gently remind us of the areas we need
to improve, too.

# 5. A friend will sacrifice for you.

“And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”
(Matt. 22:39)
“My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for
one’s friends.” (John 15:12)
_Act of Valor_ is one of my favorite movies. The acting is not perfect however
it paints a very clear picture of the power of sacrifice.

In one particular scene, several soldiers are carefully advancing into a
warehouse to take out the enemy. The team finds themselves in a room that
has a vulnerable point, and they are on high alert. The enemy tosses a hand
grenade into the center of the room. The chief, who is at the back of the team,
sees the grenade hit the floor. In just a second’s time, the chief notices the other
soldiers do not see the danger, and without thinking of how this will affect his
life, makes the decision to jump on the grenade to save their lives.

Even thinking about this sparks emotion for me. The thought of giving my
life for others is one that has crossed my mind several times. What would I do
in that split second? Would I be capable of making the same decision? I hope I
would. However, there are many other ways to sacrifice without having to give
your very life.

We can sacrifice our time to be there for a friend. We can sacrifice our
finances to provide for a friend. We can sacrifice our own desires to help make a
friend’s dream a reality. There are many ways to sacrifice ourselves for another,
especially for a friend.
