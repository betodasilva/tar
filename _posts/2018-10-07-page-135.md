```
THE ART OF INFLUENCE 135 |
```
_signals_ of right or wrong living to keep us traveling on the right path in life.

As the salt and light of the earth, Christians can influence those in our
families, our friends, our co-workers, those who see us and watch us even
from a distance, anyone we come into contact with, our church, and the
world. Imagine if all of us as believers understood our own effectiveness in
the influence we can have on the lives of others. We will influence everyone we
touch and everyone we reach, whether positively or negatively. It is because of
our relationship with God that we can influence others positively.

When we walk into a situation or room, do others immediately feel more
stable, loved, cared for, and valued? Are the people around you better off
because you are there? Be a light. Shine wherever you are. People are attracted
to light.

Just like Pastor Coetzee, we can learn that our influence carries more
weight than our authority, that influence takes time, and just like salt and light,
it continues to work behind the scenes, improving everything it touches and
reaches.
